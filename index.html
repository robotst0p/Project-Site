            <p id = "about-info"> My name is Tyler Meyer. I am a soon to be graduate of The Ohio State University with a bachelors degree in Physics in May. I love learning and problem-solving. Physics has 
                                  always given me interesting and complex problems to solve. Being able to pair my problem-solving ability with programming to create tangible results is something that I strive for.
                                  I have a passion for visualizing an idea in my head, creating a design, and building it until my idea comes to fruition.
            </p>
            <p id = "about-info-closing">Using coding to act on this passion gives me great satisfaction; a fulfillment I do not recieve from any other activity. Learning new ideas and seeing my personal journey 
                                         from complete beginner to finished product is something that never ceases to amaze me. I hope to make a career out of learning, and I do not ever want to stop pursuing the understanding
                                         of new technologies.
            </p>
