            <p id = "about-info"> My name is Tyler Meyer and I am a soon to be graduate from the University of Ohio State studying physics. 
                I love physics, mathematics, programming and most of all: problem-solving. 
                Physics has always given me interesting and complex problems to solve, and I love pairing this with programming to build visual solutions to these mathematical puzzles. 
                I have a passion for visualizing an idea in my head, creating a design and building it until my idea comes to fruition.
            </p>
            <p id = "about-info-closing">Using coding to act on this passion gives me a great satisfaction that I have not gotten from any other activity. 
                I love learning new technologies and the fact that I will never completely master coding as there is always something new to learn and implement.
                I hope to make a career in this field and further develop this life long passion.
            </p>
            <p id = "about-site">This site will be a place for me to host any projects related to Web Developement or design, and just to experiment. This site was written from scratch, the code can be found on my GitHub linked below.
